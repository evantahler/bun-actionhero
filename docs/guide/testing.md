description: Testing with Bun's built-in test runner — real HTTP requests, no mocking.

# Testing

We don't mock the server. That's a deliberate choice — if you're testing an API, you should be making real HTTP requests against a real running server. Now that Bun includes `fetch` out of the box, this is trivially easy.

## Test Structure

Each test file boots and stops the full server in `beforeAll`/`afterAll`. Tests use dynamic port binding (`WEB_SERVER_PORT=0`) so each file gets a random available port — no conflicts when running multiple test files:

```ts
import { api } from "../../api";
import { serverUrl, HOOK_TIMEOUT } from "../setup";

let url: string;

beforeAll(async () => {
  await api.start();
  url = serverUrl();
}, HOOK_TIMEOUT);

afterAll(async () => {
  await api.stop();
}, HOOK_TIMEOUT);

test("status endpoint returns server info", async () => {
  const res = await fetch(url + "/api/status");
  const body = (await res.json()) as ActionResponse<Status>;

  expect(res.status).toBe(200);
  expect(body.name).toBe("server");
  expect(body.uptime).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

Yes, this means each test file starts the entire server — database connections, Redis, the works. It's slower than unit testing with mocks, but you're testing what actually happens when a client hits your API. I'll take that tradeoff every time.

## Test Helpers

The `backend/__tests__/setup.ts` file provides helpers used across the test suite:

- **`serverUrl()`** — Returns the actual URL the web server bound to (with resolved port). Call after `api.start()`.
- **`HOOK_TIMEOUT`** — A generous timeout (15s) for `beforeAll`/`afterAll` hooks, since they connect to Redis, Postgres, run migrations, etc. Pass as the second argument to `beforeAll`/`afterAll`.
- **`waitFor(condition, { interval, timeout })`** — Polls a condition function until it returns `true`, or throws after a timeout. Use this instead of fixed `Bun.sleep()` calls when waiting for async side effects like background tasks:

```ts
await waitFor(
  async () => {
    const result = await db.query(
      "SELECT count(*) FROM jobs WHERE status = 'done'",
    );
    return result.count > 0;
  },
  { interval: 100, timeout: 5000 },
);
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# all backend tests
cd backend && bun test

# a single file
cd backend && bun test __tests__/actions/user.test.ts

# full CI — lint + test both frontend and backend
bun run ci
```

Tests run non-concurrently to avoid port conflicts. Each test file gets the server to itself.

## Making Requests

Just use `fetch`. Here's a typical test for creating a user:

```ts
test("create a user", async () => {
  const res = await fetch(url + "/api/user", {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: "Test User",
      email: "test@example.com",
      password: "password123",
    }),
  });

  const body = await res.json();
  expect(res.status).toBe(200);
  expect(body.user.name).toBe("Test User");
});
```

Nothing special — it's the same `fetch` you'd use in a browser or a Bun script.

## Database Setup

Tests typically clear the database before running to ensure a clean slate:

```ts
beforeAll(async () => {
  await api.start();
  await api.db.clearDatabase();
});
```

`clearDatabase()` truncates all tables with `RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE`. It refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production`, so you can't accidentally nuke your production data.

You'll need a separate test database:

```bash
createdb keryx-test
```

Set `DATABASE_URL_TEST` in your environment (or `backend/.env`) to point at it.

## Gotcha: Stale Processes

If you're changing code but your tests are still seeing old behavior… you probably have a stale server process running from a previous dev session. This has bitten me more than once:

```bash
ps aux | grep "bun keryx" | grep -v grep
kill -9 <PIDs>
```

Check for old processes whenever code changes aren't being reflected. It'll save you hours of debugging.
