  text: The Fullstack TypeScript Framework for MCP and APIs
  tagline: One action class. Five transports. Your API is automatically an MCP server, WebSocket handler, CLI tool, and background task runner. Built on Bun, powered by Zod.

features:
  - icon: "\U0001F916"
    title: MCP-Native
    details: Every action is automatically an MCP tool. AI agents discover and call your API through the Model Context Protocol — with OAuth 2.1 auth and llms.txt support.
  - icon: "\U0001F500"
    title: One Action, Every Transport
    details: Write your controller once — HTTP endpoint, WebSocket handler, CLI command, background task, and MCP tool. Same validation, same middleware, same response.
  - icon: "\U0001F6E1\uFE0F"
    title: Zod Validation
    details: Type-safe inputs with automatic validation. Your Zod schemas generate OpenAPI docs, power CLI --help, and validate WebSocket params — all from one definition.
  - icon: "\u26A1"
    title: Built on Bun
    details: Native TypeScript, fast startup, built-in test runner, no compilation step. Bun handles bundling, testing, and module resolution out of the box.
  - icon: "\U0001F4E1"
    title: Real-Time Channels
    details: PubSub over Redis with middleware-based authorization. Define channel patterns, control who can subscribe, and broadcast to WebSocket clients.
  - icon: "\u2699\uFE0F"
    title: Background Tasks & Fan-Out
    details: Built-in Resque workers with a fan-out pattern for distributing work across child jobs. Track progress and collect results automatically.
  - icon: "\U0001F5C4\uFE0F"
    title: Drizzle ORM
    details: First-class database support with auto-migrations and type-safe schemas. No separate ORM plugin needed — it's part of the stack.
  - icon: "\U0001F4CA"
    title: Observability & Structured Logging
    details: Built-in OpenTelemetry metrics, plus structured logging for log aggregation. Correlation IDs trace requests across services.

## One Action, Every Transport

This is one action:

```ts
export class UserCreate implements Action {
  name = "user:create";
  description = "Create a new user";
  inputs = z.object({
    name: z.string().min(3),
    email: z.string().email(),
    password: secret(z.string().min(8)),
  });
  web = { route: "/user", method: HTTP_METHOD.PUT };
  task = { queue: "default" };

  async run(params: ActionParams<UserCreate>) {
    const user = await createUser(params);
    return { user: serializeUser(user) };
  }
}
```

That one class gives you:

**HTTP** — `PUT /api/user` with JSON body, query params, or form data:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/user \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Evan","email":"evan@example.com","password":"secret123"}'
```

**WebSocket** — send a JSON message over an open connection:

```json
{
  "messageType": "action",
  "action": "user:create",
  "params": {
    "name": "Evan",
    "email": "evan@example.com",
    "password": "secret123"
  }
}
```

**CLI** — flags are generated from the Zod schema automatically:

```bash
./keryx.ts "user:create" --name Evan --email evan@example.com --password secret123 -q | jq
```

**Background Task** — enqueued to a Resque worker via Redis:

```ts
await api.actions.enqueue("user:create", {
  name: "Evan",
  email: "evan@example.com",
  password: "secret123",
});
```

**MCP** — exposed as a tool for AI agents automatically:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-app": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Same validation, same middleware chain, same `run()` method, same response shape. The only thing that changes is how the request arrives and how the response is delivered.

## Why Keryx?

Most backends start simple — an HTTP framework — then bolt on a WebSocket server, a CLI tool, a job queue, and now an MCP layer. Each one has its own handler, its own validation, its own auth. You end up maintaining five implementations of the same logic.

Keryx flips that: write your controller once, and the framework delivers it across every transport.

## Why Bun?

- **Native TypeScript** — no compilation step, no `tsconfig` gymnastics
- **Built-in test runner** — `bun test` with watch mode, no extra dependencies
- **Fast startup** — sub-second cold starts for dev and production
- **Module resolution that works** — ESM, CommonJS, and `.ts` imports without configuration
- **`fetch` included natively** — great for testing your own API

## Quick Start

```bash
bunx keryx new my-app
cd my-app
cp .env.example .env
bun install
bun dev
```

Requires Bun, PostgreSQL, and Redis. See the [Getting Started guide](/guide/) for full setup instructions.
