## Running Tests

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
bun test                           # Run all tests
bun test __tests__/path/file.test.ts  # Run specific test file
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
bun test                           # Run all tests
bun test __tests__/path/file.test.ts  # Run specific test file
```

## Test Guidelines

- Tests must be run from their respective directories (backend or frontend)
- For HTTP tests:
  - DELETE/POST/PUT requests need a body (at least "{}")
  - GET requests should not include a body
  - Include "Content-Type": "application/json" in headers when sending JSON
  - For authenticated endpoints, include session cookie in headers
- Clean up test data in afterAll blocks
- Use beforeAll for test setup and data creation
- Test both success and failure cases
- Verify side effects (e.g., checking session destruction by attempting protected endpoint access)
