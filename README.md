## What is this Project?

This project aims to be a "modern" rewrite of the "full" ActionHero stack. It is a template for a new project, and is not yet feature complete. It is a work in progress.

I still believe in many of the ideas of Actionhero, which itself was an attempt to take the "best" ideas from Rails and and Node.js and shove them together.

### The key components of this project remain:

- Transport-agnostic Actions (HTTP, WebSockets, CLI, etc)
- Built-in support for background tasks (via [node-resque](https://github.com/actionhero/node-resque))
- Built in, strongly-typed API support connecting the backend to the frontend
- (new) Built-in support for ORM/models/migrations (replacing the `ah-sequelize-plugin`, which adds drizzleORM to the mix; optionally using SQLite locally)
- (new) Companion frontend application (replacing the `ah-next-plugin`), which adds Next.js to the mix - the frontend is a separate application, and is not bundled into the backend.

### Why Bun?

TS/JS is still the best language for any web API. However, node.js has stalled and is not moving forward. Bun is a modern, fast, and easy to use package manager that is a great fit for this project which includes:

- Bundling
- Testing
- Module Resolution
- Amazing Packager
- Great DX.

## Project Structure

- **root**: a slim package.json which wraps the backend and frontend directories. This is for convenience when developing. The regular commands `bun install`, `bun dev`, `bun tests`, etc will work from the root, but note the `s` at the end of `bun tests`.
- **backend**: The actionhero server.
- **frontend**: The frontend next.js application.

## Local Development

Install Dependencies (macOS):

```bash
# install bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# install postgres
brew install postgresql

# install redis
brew install redis

# start postgres and redis
brew services start postgresql
brew services start redis

# create a database
createdb bun
```

To install packages:

```bash
bun install
```

Set environment variables:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
# update as needed
```

To run:

```bash
# run both the front-end and back-end from the root directory
bun dev
```

Both the front-end and back-end will hot-reload when files change!

To test:

```bash
# one time db setup
createdb bun-test

# run all tests
bun ci # runs linting, compilation, and all tests
# or
bun tests # runs just the tests (note the s at the end)

# run a single test file
cd backend
bun test __tests__/actions/user.test.ts
```

To lint:

```bash
# To test
bun lint
# To Fix
bun pretty
```

## Production Builds

```bash
# pre-compile the front-end and backend
bun compile
# in .env, set NODE_ENV=production and set next.dev=false
bun start
```

## Databases and Migrations

This project uses Drizzle as the ORM. Migrations are derived from the schemas. To create a migration from changes in `scheams/*.ts` run `bun run migrations.ts`. Then, restart the server - pending migrations are auto-applied.

## Actions, CLI Commands, and Tasks

Unlike Actionhero, we've removed the distinction between Actions, CLI commands, and Tasks. They are all the same thing now! You can run any action from the CLI, and any action can be scheduled as a task. The same input validation and responses are used for each, just like how Actions work for both web and websocket requests.

Run an action from the CLI:

```bash
# I like using -q (hide logging output) and then piping the response through jq

 ./actionhero.ts "user:create" --name evan --email "evantahler@gmail.com" --password password -q | jq

# use the --help flag to learn more
```

### Web Actions

Add a `web` property to the action to enable it to be called via HTTP:

```ts
web = { route: "/message", method: HTTP_METHOD.PUT };
```

### CLI Actions

Enabled by default

### Websocket Actions

Enabled by default

### Task Actions

Actions which have a `task` property can be scheduled as a task. A `queue` property is required, and a `frequency` property is optional to automatically schedule these tasks in a cron-like manner.

```ts
task = { queue: "default", frequency: 1000 * 60 * 60 }; // run the task every hour
```

## Intentional changes from ActionHero

**Multiple Applications**

Rather than bundling in the frontend into the backend, we are running two separate Bun applications. This allows each app to do what it does best, and for you to deploy them independently. e.g. perhaps you want to host the frontend on Vercel, or statically compile it.

In development, we use `node-foreman` and `Procfile` to run both the frontend and backend at the same time.

**Actions, Tasks, and CLI Commands**

All 'controllers' are the same now! Actions are used for tasks and command line execution now, and configured for each purpose via properties. This should simplify things, and encourage reusability even more.

**Logger**

Simplified logger. No more winston - only STDOUT and STDERR remain. Basic logging levels are supported, and colors and timestamps are optional.

**Process**

No more `pidfiles`.

**Config**

Config remains statically defined at boot. However, there's now per-env overwrites based on NODE_ENV (e.g. `logger.level.test` trumps `logger.level` when `NODE_ENV=test`.)

**Middleware**

Middleware is applied to actions as an array of `ActionMiddleware` objects. Middleware is run before and after the action is run if the `.runBefore` and `.runAfter` methods are defined. Middleware can be used for authentication, authorization, logging, and more. Optionally, middleware can throw an error to halt execution of the action. Middleware can also modify the params or the response.

```ts
middleware = [SessionMiddleware];
```

**Routes**

Actions define their own routes as regular expression matchers (no `routes.ts`)

**CLI**

CLI runs regular actions, not special CLI controllers.

**Testing**

No mock server. Let's make real API requests. Now that bun has `fetch` included, it's easy!

**ORM**

We use drizzle for the ORM and migrations.

**Cache**

The actionhero cache layer has been removed. Instead, use redis directly... it's still part of the stack.

**Sessions**

Sessions are handled via cookies, and now a first-class part of the API. Session data is stored in redis.

## Production Deployment

Each application has its own Dockerfile, and a docker-compose.yml file to run them together. You probably won't use this in production directly, but it shows you an example of how to deploy the project.
