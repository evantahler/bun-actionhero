**Core Principles: Be minimal, surgical, elegant, and correct.**

Before writing code, always make a plan about how to best implement the feature. Then, follow the plan, checking of each step is complete before moving on to the next.

We use `bun` for every command, we do not use npm, node.js, or yarn,

Always run `bun lint` after writing tests to format the code.

This is a monorepo, with a top-level `package.json` to run things in development, and then 2 sub-projects for the `backend` and `frontend`.
