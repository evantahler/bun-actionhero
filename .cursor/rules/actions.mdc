# Running Actions

How to run actions from the command line interface.

## Basic Usage

Actions can be run from the CLI using the `actionhero.ts` script in the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
./actionhero.ts "actionName" [options] -q | jq
```

## Examples

### Check Server Status
```bash
./actionhero.ts "status" -q | jq
```

This will return server information including:
- Server name
- Process ID
- Version
- Uptime
- Memory usage

## Options

- `-q`: Hide logging output
- `--help`: Show help information for the action
- `| jq`: Format the JSON response nicely (requires jq to be installed)

## Notes

- All actions can be run from the CLI
- The same input validation and responses are used as when running actions via HTTP or WebSocket
- Actions can also be scheduled as tasks if they have a `task` property
