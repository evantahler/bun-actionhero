# Testing

Information about running and writing tests.

## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
bun tests
```

### CI Pipeline
```bash
bun ci
```
Runs linting, compilation, and all tests

### Single Test File
```bash
cd backend
bun test __tests__/actions/user.test.ts
```

## Test Structure
- Tests are located in `__tests__` directories
- Action tests are in `backend/__tests__/actions/`
- Each test file corresponds to an action file

## Writing Tests
- Use `test()` for individual test cases
- Use `describe()` for grouping related tests
- Use `expect()` for assertions
- Tests should be independent and not rely on each other

## Test Database
- Tests use a separate database: `bun-test`
- Database is automatically created when needed
- Each test should clean up after itself

## Debugging Tests
- Add `console.log()` statements
- Use Cursor's debugger
- Run specific test files to isolate issues
